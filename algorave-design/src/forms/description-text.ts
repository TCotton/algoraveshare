                    <li>🎛️ Creative Intent<br />
                        What inspired this pattern or composition? What kind of vibe, rhythm, or sonic texture were you
                        aiming for?<br />
                        > Example: I wanted a rolling minimal techno repetition that morphs into more chaotic textures over time.
                    </li>

                    <li>🧠 Musical Structure<br />
                        How is the timing or pattern organized? Mention cycles, phrases, or evolving layers.<br />
                        > Example: It loops every 8 bars, with each repeat introducing a new melodic variation.
                    </li>

                    <li>🧩 Code & Techniques<br />
                        Which functions or operators are central to this idea?
                        (TidalCycles: \`every\`, \`when\`, \`superimpose\`, \`hurry\`, etc.)
                        (Strudel: \`map\`, \`withEffects\`, \`fast\`, \`stack\`, etc.)<br />
                        > Example: I used \`superimpose\` in Tidal / \`stack\` in Strudel to layer two rhythms.
                    </li>

                    <li>🎚️ Sound Design & Effects<br />
                        How do you shape the sound or texture?
                        (Tidal: \`reverb\`, \`hpf\`, \`crush\`, \`shape\` | Strudel: \`withFx\`, \`filter\`, \`reverb\`, \`delay\`.)<br />
                        > Example: I added delay and filter sweeps to make the high-end shimmer.
                    </li>

                    <li>🎹 Performance & Interactivity<br />
                        How would you perform or tweak this live?<br />
                        > Example: I like to slowly fade density or switch samples live to evolve the groove.
                    </li>

                    <li>💡 Reflection & Sharing<br />
                        What did you learn, discover, or experiment with? Any advice for others?<br />
                        > Example: I learned how changing \`speed\` subtly changes the feel.
                    </li>

                    <li> 🎧 Listening Notes (optional)<br />
                        What should listeners pay attention to?<br />
                        > Example: The hats slowly shift phase against the kick, creating tension.
