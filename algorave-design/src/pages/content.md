🎛️ Creative Intent  
What inspired this pattern or composition? What kind of vibe, rhythm, or sonic texture were you aiming for?
> Example: I wanted a rolling minimal groove that morphs into more chaotic textures over time.

🧠 Musical Structure  
How is the timing or pattern organized? Mention cycles, phrases, or evolving layers.
> Example: It loops every 8 bars, with each repeat introducing a new melodic variation.

🧩 Code & Techniques  
Which functions or operators are central to this idea?  
(TidalCycles: `every`, `when`, `superimpose`, `hurry`, etc.)  
(Strudel: `map`, `withEffects`, `fast`, `stack`, etc.)
> Example: I used `superimpose` in Tidal / `stack` in Strudel to layer two rhythms.

🎚️ Sound Design & Effects  
How do you shape the sound or texture?  
(Tidal: `reverb`, `hpf`, `crush`, `shape` | Strudel: `withFx`, `filter`, `reverb`, `delay`.)
> Example: I added delay and filter sweeps to make the high-end shimmer.

🎹 Performance & Interactivity  
How would you perform or tweak this live?
> Example: I like to slowly fade density or switch samples live to evolve the groove.

💡 Reflection & Sharing  
What did you learn, discover, or experiment with? Any advice for others?
> Example: I learned how changing `speed` subtly changes the groove feel.

🎧 Listening Notes (optional)  
What should listeners pay attention to?
> Example: The hats slowly shift phase against the kick, creating tension.
