This is a minimal Next.js placeholder for the frontend. Run:

npm install
npm run dev

Testing
-------

All frontend code must include unit tests written with Vitest. Place tests next to the source files (e.g. `Component.test.jsx` or in `__tests__/`). CI will block PRs that add source files without tests.
